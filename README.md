# Leetcode
Messing around with algorithms for Leetcode. File name corresponds loosely with problem name. Naming convention dictates that the version
without a number following it is the latest/most optimized version. For example, longestPalindrome > longestPalindrome1 > longestPalindrome2,
with longestPalindrome2 being the oldest and least optimized version and longestPalindrome being the newest and most optimized version.
